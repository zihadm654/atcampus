### 4. Relationship Enhancements

- **School ↔ ProfessorInvitation**: Schools can track sent invitations
- **Faculty ↔ ProfessorInvitation**: Faculties track professor assignments
- **Course ↔ CourseApprovalWorkflow**: One-to-one workflow tracking
- **User ↔ Course**: Enhanced instructor relationships with proper MongoDB syntax
- **Member ↔ Faculty**: Enhanced professor assignment tracking

### 5. Indexing Improvements

Added strategic indexes for:
- Professor invitation queries by status and faculty
- Course approval workflows by level and status
- Member queries by role and assignment date
- Institution-specific user queries
- Course submission and review tracking

### 6. MongoDB Compatibility

- Fixed many-to-many relationships to use explicit field references
- Proper array field usage for MongoDB document structure
- Optimized for document-based queries and updates

## Workflow Support

The enhanced schema now fully supports:

1. **Institution Management**: Complete organizational hierarchy
2. **Professor Invitations**: End-to-end invitation and acceptance workflow
3. **Faculty Assignments**: Detailed professor-faculty relationships
4. **Course Creation**: Rich course metadata and prerequisites
5. **Multi-Level Approval**: Configurable approval workflows
6. **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of all actions and decisions
7. **Notifications**: Real-time updates for all stakeholders

## Database Migration Notes

When applying these changes:
1. Backup existing data
2. Run `prisma db push` to apply schema changes
3. Existing courses may need `approvalWorkflow` creation
4. Member records may need professor-specific field population
5. Consider data migration scripts for status enum changes

## Validation Status

✅ Schema validation passed successfully
✅ All relationships properly defined
✅ MongoDB-specific syntax correctly implemented
✅ Indexing strategy optimized for expected queries
